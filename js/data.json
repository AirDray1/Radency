The realization of startups depends on the ecosystem in which they were born. Among several points, highlighting public sector policies and actions oriented to the development of the entrepreneurship sector such as: tax incentives, modernized and facilitated business creation environment, attractive financing programs, stable economic environment, an educational system that already takes into account in the curriculums soft skills and encourages entrepreneurship."

At a time of fierce global competition, the distance between technical promise and genuine achievement is a matter of especially grave concern. Drawing on their long study of the difficulties managers have had in closing this gap, the authors identify half a dozen key challenges that managers responsible for implementing new technology must surmount: their inescapably dual role, the variety of internal markets to be served, legitimate resistance to change, the right degree of promotion, the choice of implementation site, and the need for one person to take overall responsibility.",
